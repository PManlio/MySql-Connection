# MySql-Connection
I made this simple Log-in application because a wanted to try the MySQL JDBC connector library.

Try it on Netbeans, including mysql-connector-java-5.1.23-bin.jar as an external lib (otherwise program won't work).
You need to create a local database (and for this you need XAMPP + (optional) MySQL Workbench) in which you create a table with name, password and type as attributes
(the type is optional, it was for a university project. But if you want to exlude this attribute, you need to rewrite part of the Login.java code)
